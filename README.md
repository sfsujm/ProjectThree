## project overview
Project three is about showcasing a social issue while using our own custom branding and design within a website with 3-4 pages. The social issue I chose is one that has been going on for quite a while now. The SAG-AFTRA also known as Screen Actors Guild- American Federation of Television and Radio Artists is an American labour union and their movement was previosuly focused on striking against movies and tv since there is unfair treatment in terms of the actors salary after failed negotiations. Right now the big focus of impact is on the video game industry for the threat of AI being used in the medium.

With the ever looming threat of unregulated anf unfair uses of AI, this problem has been brought to the forefront in video games as a mostly digital medium. Companies plan to take the voice actors own voices and train an AI on them to ensure that they will never be brought back to the actual studio. Essentially they are being replaced by an synthetic voice that very closely matches their tones. As you can guess, many are opposed to this issue hence why the strikes are going on. I noticed this issue firsthand when I was playing a new update for an ongoing game titled "Genshin Impact", which has contained a large many voice actors and actresses contributing to the huge success of this game, where the newest update was missing many voices for its playable characters and were left unvoiced. Many in the playerbase was wondering what was going on and were then exposed to SAG-AFTRA for the first time. I knew about them during the Hollywood strikes. 

Since this is a game I am actively playing, I wanted to cover this as there are great natural voice talent present in this game that I do not wish to fall to AI simulation. It is looking especially dire when big name game studios like EA (Electronic Arts), Epic Games, and a few others and the recording studios themselves like Formosa Interactive are the ones actively pushing this situation. This situation has had the voice talent transferring to more trusted recording studios in the process.


## technical overview
In this project, extensive use of html and css were used to create 3-4 structured pages of this website with a specific theming. The wireframe was first made in figma and any other custom made graphic/art resources were made in (etc.) The website I am making will contain info on the festival and it's location. There will be a description of each major event over the days which invluces real voice actor/actress meetup, indie game showcase, and a mini strike over the course of a few days. The merch will be of the logo I made and maybe I will create custom keychains simulating fan merch since that promotes human made creativity along the indie game showcase.
